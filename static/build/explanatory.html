            You are invited to take part in this study. Please read this Explanatory
            Statement in full before deciding whether or not to participate in this
            research. If you would like further information regarding any aspect of
            this project, you are encouraged to contact the researchers via the phone
            numbers or email addresses listed above.

        <h3 id="what-does-the-research-involve" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">What does the research involve?</h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            This study is designed to study the effectiveness of different
            types of error messages in the Chameleon type checking tool.
            Chameleon is a tool we have developed to help programmers
            identify and solve Haskell type errors.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            Once you have navigated to the user study website, you will be
            prompted with 9 different code challenges. Each code challenge is an
            editable code fragment in a web page, presented with debugging
            information on the right side of the webpage to help you investigate
            the type errors (if there are any).
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            Chameleon can be configured in three modes; each mode has a
            different information density and interactive level. In basic mode,
            debugging information is concise, and you have minimal control over
            the display of an error message. In balanced mode, you have moderate
            control to narrow down the possible cause of a type error. In
            advanced mode, you have access to a maximal amount of debugging
            information and granular control in tracing the root cause of type
            errors. At the start of each code challenge, the Chameleon debugging
            tool is set to one of the three modes. However, you are free to
            switch between modes by pressing the tab key or clicking the
            dedicated mode switching buttons.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            After the study, you will be asked to leave overall feedback of your
            experience in working with Chameleon debugger.
        </p>
        <h3 id="how-do-we-collect-the-data" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">How do we collect the data?</h3>
        <p class="my-2">We will collect the data in two methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Through post-study web form.</li>
            <li>
                2. Through tele-metrics during the time you working on the
                challenges. This include tracking important timings (e.g. when
                you start and complete a certain challenge), and usage patterns
                (e.g. how many time do you consult the error message before
                making an edit) in your web browser.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="my-2">
            You can choose to withdraw from further participation at any stage.
            To withdraw from this study, you simply close the user study website
            tab in the web browser. We will erase all the data associate with
            your session if you did not complete the study. Additionally, we
            will provide you a withdraw ID at the start of this study. You can
            email the student
            investigator (<a href="mailto:shuai.fu@monash.edu" target="_blank" class="url">shuai.fu@monash.edu</a>) with
            your withdraw ID at anytime to withdraw your data, even if you
            completed the study.

            Possible benefits and risks to participants
        </h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            There&#39;s no risks involved in participating this research. You
            are not required to be physically present. The study does not
            require you to perform physical activities or interact with physical
            objects. We will keep the study within a minimal time frame of 20
            minutes to avoid strain. The information you will provide in the
            study are limited to the area of programming language knowledge and
            skill.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            The user study gives no immediate benefit to the participants,
            However in the long-term, you may benefit from the tools that we
            develop as part of the research. Broadly, this user study will help
            researchers to better understand how to design, and improve the
            compiler interface and interactive IDE.
        </p>
        <h3 id="confidentiality" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">Confidentiality</h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            We will not collect any data that can be linked to your identity,
            your device, or your location. We will use a random identifier (such
            as GUID) to group the collected data by each participant.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2">
            All published data will remain anonymous. The collected data and
            questionnaire answers will be used in the publication.

        <p class="my-2">
            The members of the this project may include the user study results
            in journal articles, conference papers, or book chapters. Student
            co-investigator may include the user study result in his Ph.D.
            thesis.

        <h3 id="storage-of-data" class="text-xl font-bold  my-4">Storage of data</h3>
        <p class="my-2">
            The data will be stored offline-only, in an encrypted hard drive
            located in Australia. The members of the Interactive Haskell Type
            Inference Exploration project will be able to access the data. The
            data will be erased from the hard drive 12 months after it is
            collected.

            The members of the Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration
            project may include the user study results in journal articles,
            conference papers, or book chapters. Student co-investigator (Shuai
            Fu) may include the user study result in his Ph.D. thesis. We will
            only publish summary-formed results. No personal data will be
            published. Participants may gain access to a pre-print electronic
            version of a journal article or conference paper after it will have
            been published. Participants may gain access to the electronic
            version of the student investigator’s Ph.D. thesis after it has been
