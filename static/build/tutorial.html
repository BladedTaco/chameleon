            and a debugging window (right)

            Debugging window shows all the uncertain expressions
            as a list of cards. The focused card is black, others white.
            The content of debugging window changes when the focusing on a
            different card.

            An expression is uncertain when it can be either a
            possible type 1 or a possible type 2. In our example,
            x and y are both uncertain.

            Highlights are fragments of code with
            blue or orange backgorund. They are evidence for the
            possible types. Highlights may switch color when the
            focused card (or debugging step) changes.
            For example if we focus on y now, notice the highlight on
            line 2 changes color.

            A debugging step is a pair of highlights (one blue and one orange)
            with black outline, and a text box shows how the two are related
            to one another.

            Debugging steps can be accessed by clicking on the step button in
            the expression card. Each card may contain one or more steps.

            When changing step, highlights will switch color one at a time.
            The message in the text box changes accordingly.
            For example, clicking on step 1 and step 2 of expression x will result in
            the editor window showing two different deduction steps.
